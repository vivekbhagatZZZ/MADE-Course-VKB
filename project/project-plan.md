## Title

Uncovering the Drivers of High Drug Prices in the USA: A Data-Driven Approach to Healthcare Affordability

## Main Question

How Does the Pharmaceutical and Insurance Industry's Self-serving Goals Impact Healthcare Affordability In The United States Of America?

## Description

High drug prices in the U.S. strain many Americans, making healthcare unaffordable for low- and middle-income families. In my project about the question, “How Does the Pharmaceutical and Insurance Industry's Self-serving Goals Impact Healthcare Affordability In The United States Of America?” I intend to analyze the key drivers behind high drug prices and their impact on healthcare costs. 

Using publicly available datasets on drug prices, healthcare spending, and income levels, I intend to explore patterns in pricing strategies, regional cost differences, and the effect of transparency laws on prices. I'll also analyze state policies, insurance roles, and pharmaceutical monopolies to uncover where price escalations happen and how they affect access to necessary medications.

## Datasources

### Dataset 1: CMS Prescription Drug Utilization and Spending Data

* Data URL: https://data.cms.gov/data-api/v1/dataset/87604795-a3e2-4190-9b3a-e39142221fcd/data.csv
* Data Type: CSV

This CMS dataset provides detailed information on prescription drug utilization and spending across Medicare and Medicaid programs. It includes data on drug spending trends, total claims, unit costs, and utilization patterns, helping to analyze the relationship between drug pricing and patient access, as well as policy implications for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.

### Dataset 2: National Health Expenditures (NHE) Tables

* Data URL: https://www.cms.gov/files/zip/nhe-tables.zip
* Data Type: ZIP (contains Excel files)

The NHE dataset contains comprehensive statistics on health expenditures in the United States, segmented by service type, source of funding, and historical trends. This data is invaluable for evaluating overall healthcare spending, identifying changes in spending patterns over time, and understanding the impact of policy changes and economic factors on the nation's healthcare system.
