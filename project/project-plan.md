## Title

Uncovering the Drivers of High Drug Prices in the USA: A Data-Driven Approach to Healthcare Affordability

## Main Question

How Do The Pharmaceutical Industry’s Pricing Strategy And Other Factors Impact Healthcare Affordability In The United States Of America?

## Description

High drug prices in the U.S. strain many Americans, making healthcare unaffordable for low- and middle-income families. In my project about the question, “How Do The Pharmaceutical Industry’s Pricing Strategy and Other Factors Impact Healthcare Affordability in the United States of America?” I intend to analyze the key drivers behind high drug prices and their impact on healthcare costs. 

Using publicly available datasets on drug prices, healthcare spending, and income levels, I intend to explore patterns in pricing strategies, regional cost differences, and the effect of transparency laws on prices. I'll also analyze state policies, insurance roles, and pharmaceutical monopolies to uncover where price escalations happen and how they affect access to necessary medications.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: Drug Pricing Transparency Project (GoodRx)
* Data URL: https://www.goodrx.com/
* Data Type: Web-based API and downloadable reports

GoodRx provides real-time drug pricing information across U.S. pharmacies. This data includes price variations by location and over time, enabling an analysis of how pricing strategies differ geographically and across drug types. The data helps examine trends and drug price fluctuations and their impact on accessibility.

### Datasource2: FDA Drug Database
* Data URL: https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/drugsfda-data-files
* Data Type: CSV and XML

This FDA dataset contains information on approved drugs, including active ingredients, manufacturers, and approval dates. It allows us to examine the relationship between drug approval, patent status, and market exclusivity with pricing trends.

### Datasource3: World Bank Health Expenditure Data
* Data URL: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.CHEX.PC.CD
* Data Type: CSV and Excel

This dataset provides health expenditure data across countries, including the U.S. It enables comparisons of healthcare spending and out-of-pocket expenses, giving insight into how drug pricing impacts overall healthcare affordability.

### Datasource4: OECD Health Statistics
* Data URL: https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?ThemeTreeId=9
* Data Type: CSV and Excel

OECD Health Statistics offers data on health expenditures, health outcomes, and healthcare access metrics. This source allows us to explore connections between healthcare spending, drug costs, and health outcomes in the U.S. relative to other countries.

### Datasource5: Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Health Data
* Data URL: https://www.paho.org/data/index.php/en/
* Data Type: CSV and interactive tables

PAHO’s health data includes healthcare access, coverage, and cost indicators for the Americas. This source allows regional comparison of healthcare affordability and cost-burden trends, placing U.S. drug pricing within a broader continental context.

### Datasource6: World Bank Poverty and Equity Data
* Data URL: https://data.worldbank.org/topic/poverty
* Data Type: CSV and Excel

The Poverty and Equity dataset provides metrics on income distribution and poverty rates. Using this, we can analyze the impact of drug costs on different income groups and assess affordability disparities by socioeconomic status.

### Datasource7: United Nations Human Development Data
* Data URL: http://hdr.undp.org/en/data
* Data Type: CSV and Excel

UN data includes indices on health, education, and income. This helps to assess the broader socioeconomic impacts of drug affordability and explore links between drug prices and human development indicators in the U.S.
