# How The Pharmaceutical Industry Impacts Healthcare Affordability in the United States

## Project Description

This project analyzes the relationship between the pharmaceutical industry's practices and the rising costs of healthcare in the United States, particularly focusing on prescription drug prices. Using publicly available datasets such as the CMS Prescription Drug Utilization and Spending Data and the National Health Expenditures Tables, the project highlights the financial strain on individuals, the inefficiencies of federal insurance programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and the monopolistic behavior in the pharmaceutical sector.

## Datasets Used
- **CMS Prescription Drug Utilization and Spending Data**: A dataset centered on prescription drugs used within Medicare, including details on drug types, total spending, and claims.
- **National Health Expenditures (NHE) Tables**: A broader dataset providing insights into healthcare spending trends, broken down by service type and funding source.

## Key Findings
- Significant increases in out-of-pocket healthcare costs, with a 63.4% rise from 2000 to 2022.
- A growing disparity between the spending on brand-name drugs (dominated by monopolistic practices) versus the usage of generic alternatives.
- A 716% increase in federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid between 2000 and 2022, highlighting inefficiencies in the system.
